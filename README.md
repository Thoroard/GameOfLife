# GameOfLife
Second ever object oriented program
# What Is that ?
So basicly that was my second ever project with object oriented c++, it was entirely wrote using Clion, I put all the .h and .cpp files in src folder to simplify my Cmake command for linux launches, honestly now I dont really thinks that this makes any sense because its hard to read which file stands for which procces.
Also every class is defined in sigle .h file similar to my earlier minesweeper project (This needs correction)
